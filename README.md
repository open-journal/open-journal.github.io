#### What is Open Journal

It is strongly suggested that you anonymize you identity while contributing or viewing the content and resources within the repository via [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network), [Tor Networks](https://www.torproject.org/) to prevent proscution by the [Ministry of State Security of China](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E5%92%8C%E5%9B%BD%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E9%83%A8), and the [Cyber Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of China](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AC%E5%AE%89%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E4%BF%9D%E5%8D%AB%E5%B1%80) in the case that you frequently travel from, or to People's Republic of China.

#### Sharing of Resources and Publication
Open Journal encourages people to shared contents that reveals the true face of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and uncover people that has been prosecuted by the CCP because of them speaking up against the entity. Recently, a professor of Constitutional Law from Tsinghua University, [Xu Zhangrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Zhangrun) was prosecuted by the Chinese Police after speaking against the Party's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and he will not be the last. Therefore, we need to prompt their publications, to let them know that their effort was not in vain, and it was worth it for them to risk their livelihood and even their lives to tell people the truth.
